## How to Play

Ant Sweeper is my take on an old game called Mine Sweeper. It seemed to fit this assignment well, and I've never coded it before. It was fun to figure out.

#### Step 1

Click on any playfield area of the play field to start the game.

#### Step 2

Now choose an area you wish to uncover looking to avoid mines! (fingers crossed) When you click an area, it shows you what was underneath. 

#### Step 3

WE GOT LUCKY! IT'S A ZERO. When there is a clear area under your click, the ground will tell you how many bombs are counted in the adjacent squares.

ZERO means we are clear all around the area with the ZERO in it, so we click all around the zero getting new numbers and info on possible bomb sites!

#### Step 4

Keep going, every time you click a square and there's no bomb you get a point. When you hit an X it's game over and if you got the high score it will be saved.

Good Luck!
